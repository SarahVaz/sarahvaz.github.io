 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">Throughout my academic career, there have been many useful and helpful skills I have acquired.&nbsp; From the Foundations portion of my academic career here at The University at Buffalo, I have gained some of the most impactful and useful skills that will help me in many future professional situations. The two skills I have gained are the ability to professionally present my personal research and data using a poster presentation, and to critically analyze themes and representation within a video game.</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Skill: Professionally Present Information</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To present research and data in a professional manner is a skill I gained in one of my communication literacy courses. The course that I gained this skill in was EAS 360 STEM Communications. Overall that course focused much on how to properly communicate when in a professional setting.&nbsp; One of the main projects for that course was to choose an issue, whether on or off campus, to research and collect data about in order to construct a recommendation for how to address the issue.&nbsp; The issue I had chosen to address in my project was the frequent false fire alarms that were occurring within the Red Jacket resident halls. After researching and collecting data about the issue I had to write a White Paper where I introduced the issue, provided my research, provided a conclusion about the situation, and included my final recommendations on how to resolve the issue.&nbsp; From that paper I then had to condense my work and create a poster presentation of my project.&nbsp; I learned how to professionally condense and present my research and topic. I learned how to arrange all aspects of my project so that it is visually appealing and easy to follow. I also gained the skill of clearly showing my results using charts and pie graphs so it is easier for the reader to visualize the results of my survey. The most important and useful skill throughout this whole process that I have gained was the ability to condense my research and represent it in a clear and visually appealing way that is professionally as easily presentable.</span> </span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: x-small;">Poster Presentation</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my poster project for my project.&nbsp; I utilized headers and sectioning, as well as a pleasant color scheme, to show the work I had done.&nbsp; I was able to understand when things should be broken up in paragraphs, bullet points, or by numbering, so that the information is easier to read.&nbsp; This skill of being able to present information in a professional way is something that I feel will only help me in the future when I am in a professional workplace. There are many instances where information needs to be presented in a clear way so that all members can follow and be on the same page about a topic. I feel that going into the game design field will require me to be able to present my thoughts and ideas in a professional manner. I will need to be able to design professional documents that are clear, concise, and visually appealing. All of these skills I was able to gain and use in this one project will stay with me and help me in any professional setting I find myself in.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Skill: Critically analyze themes and representations within a video game</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An extremely important skill I have gained from my diversity course is how to critically analyze themes and representations within a video game.&nbsp; My diversity course was DMS 448 Games, Gender and Culture. In that class we focused a lot around the representation of gender, race, and culture within video games. For the semester long project, we were asked to choose a video game and analyze a theme or a cultural aspect that is represented within it.&nbsp; For the project I choose the game Senua’s Sacrifice and decided to focus on how mental illness is represented within that game.&nbsp; I also focused on how society is portrayed in the game and the overall message it sends to the player.&nbsp; This project required us to play through the game and record ourselves playing it. After the play through of the game I had to make a 25-30 minute video of me analyzing the representation of mental illness within the game using my game footage. I needed to be able to show the viewer the exact moments of the game I am referencing.&nbsp; This class and project specifically have really helped me to pay more attention to things that are shown in video games. Before this project and class, I would often just play video games mindlessly without putting much thought into the messages they send and how certain things are represented. This project required me to do a lot of outside research on the game and its representation of mental illness so that I would be able to accurately discuss it in my video. Not only did I make a video analyzing the game, but I also made a PowerPoint presentation of the main points I discuss in my video. The multiple steps and aspects of this project helped me to practice my analytical skills and pay more attention to aspects of the game I would have normally never noticed.</span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"><img src="_19271_1/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-18%20at%204.48.16%20PM.png" width="474" height="265" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: x-small;">Screenshots taken from PowerPoint presentation</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within this project I was required to pay attention to the mechanics, the historical context, the characters, and the narrative of the game. These screenshots show how I was able to connect the abilities the player has in the game to this overarching theme of mental illness. These screenshots also show how I gained the ability to focus on these different aspects within a game and connect it to how mental illness is being represented. From that I also was able to understand the overall message this game sends about how society influences the way mental illness is seen. The critical analysis of this game lead me to understand a bigger issue within todays society.&nbsp; Because I want a career in game design, I believe that this skill I have gained will help me tremendously in my professional future. To be a part of the game developing process requires workers to be able to critically think and analyze the games they are working on.&nbsp; This class and project taught me that all aspects of a game work together to create meaning.&nbsp; This helps me to understand that I must be mindful in design decisions I would be making for certain games because these decisions play a role in the overall representation of something in that game. Being able to analyze a game can also contribute to the ability to analyze other media such as film.&nbsp; This is a skill that can be utilized in many different settings and I am grateful to have gained it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
