 <h3 class="section-title">About Me</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;">My name is Sarah Vazquez and I am a Digital Media Studies major with a Computer Science minor at the University at Buffalo. I was born and raised in New York City. I have lived on campus at Buffalo for the past four years and have honestly missed the city life.&nbsp; One of my main hobbies throughout my life has been playing video games.&nbsp; This hobby was my motivation in initially choosing to major in Computer Science. My dream career path was to become a developer and programmer for a major video game company.&nbsp; I believed that becoming a Computer Science major was the best thing for me to do in order to achieve the career I wanted.&nbsp; However, after a couple of years being a Computer Science major, I discovered that programming and developing isn’t my strong suite or my passion. Regardless, I still wanted to have a career in video games.&nbsp; This is when I decided, after much research, to try and focus on the design aspect of video game development.&nbsp; After becoming a Digital Media Studies major, I have taken many classes that focus on art, design, animation, and game studies.&nbsp; The most impactful classes have been Game and Animation Workshop, Game design, and Games, Gender and Culture. These classes have helped me discover my true passion for the design and animation aspects of video games.</span></p> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;">Along with game design I have a passion for graphic design and media studies. I have always had an interest in art and have enjoyed classes that have to do with digital art and design.&nbsp; Outside of classes I have worked on many personal projects using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.&nbsp; I have also spent much time building up my portfolio by continuing to work on projects I have started in classes.</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Relevant Experience: Collaborative Artwork</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;">One impactful experience I have had outside of the classroom has been being a part of a group of peers that works on graphic design.&nbsp; We would discuss through Discord and collaborate on pieces of artwork that were inspired by different video games that have impacted us.&nbsp; I had worked with this small group of peers from 2018 to the beginning of 2019. I do still keep in contact with the group, but I have not participated in any collaborative artwork since then. This experience has greatly increased my knowledge and comfortability with programs like Photoshop and Illustrator.&nbsp; Being a part of this group also allowed me to engage with my love for video games and construct and produce artwork from that inspiration. I believe that this experience has made me a better student and learner because I was able to constructively work with others, gain leadership skills, and learn from my peers. &nbsp;Collaborating with others on artwork for video games is something that I would be interested in continuing throughout my career. This experience has allowed me to discover what it is like to work in an artistic environment. In the game design field, there is a lot of collaboration and group work that takes place and I believe that this experience has helped me gain confidence that I will be able to thrive in that environment. This experience has even made me excited for it. Below is a piece of artwork that I had worked on during that time.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;font-size: x-small;color: rgb(128,128,128);"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;">The Positive Side of Gaming - Sarah Vazquez</span></span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;color: rgb(51,51,51);">&nbsp;I created this artwork as a representation of the positivity that can stem from playing video games. My inspiration for this piece was that often times there is a negative stigma about video games, and I wanted to highlight all the positive things that are often overlooked. This artwork was made using Adobe Illustrator and the words and ideas expressed was a collaborative effort of the group. From this I have gained experience in design and got to incorporate my passion for video games.&nbsp; Working on this artwork has also deepened my understanding of the effects video games can have on people and how important they are.</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Relevant Experience: Teaching Assistant</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;">Another experience I am grateful to have outside of the classroom is being a Teaching Assistant.&nbsp; I was a TA for CSE 199 for two semesters in fall of 2017 and 2018.&nbsp; An opportunity to be a TA was one of the most helpful and inspiring experiences I’ve had during my college career. As a TA I was able to develop close relationships with professors and fellow peers.&nbsp; I was a TA for a recitation that took place once a week for a class of about 25 students. It was an experience that taught me leadership, and responsibility.&nbsp; It was my first experience in a work like setting.&nbsp; We had weekly meetings where we would go over the progress of the classes and talk about what is expected of us for the following week.&nbsp; This experience has made me a better leader because I had to be able to answer questions and guide a group of students through activities. I had to be clear and knowledge about the activities. It made me a better student because I was able to gain insight from instructors directly on what is expected of students and how to be successful as one in any class.<img src="/images/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-11%20at%208.45.55%20AM.png" width="425" height="274" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;font-size: x-small;color: rgb(128,128,128);"></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;font-size: x-small;color: rgb(128,128,128);">Screenshot&nbsp;of some responsibilities&nbsp;I had as a TA</span></span></span></span></span></span></p> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;"><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;font-size: x-small;color: rgb(128,128,128);"></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , times;font-size: 13.0px;text-align: center;text-indent: 0.5in;background-color: transparent;">Each week I was expected to know how to conduct the activity that the students will be doing so that I can provide instructions and guidance throughout the class. As a TA I was responsible for helping students and also grading their participation and their progress through activities. I was expected to give feedback on the activities that we had led for that week in order to improve on them. The responsibilities and skills that I have learned and developed will help me in any future professional space that I am in. I have gained skills in professional communication and leadership that will give me an advantage when going into the gaming industry.</span></p>
