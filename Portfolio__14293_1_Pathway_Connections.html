 <h3 class="section-title">Global Pathway: Business, Economy and Society</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"> </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">The topic for my Global Pathway is Business, Economy and Society. &nbsp;This topic focuses on the gears of society.&nbsp; This topic addresses the multiple aspects within a society that keeps it running and keeps it evolving.&nbsp; The classes I have chosen for this pathway are DMS 220 Machines, Codes and Cultures, PHI 105 Contemporary Moral Problems, and PSY 331 Social Psychology.&nbsp; </span></p> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"> </span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">DMS 220 Machines, Codes, and Cultures </span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lecture focused on the evolution of technology and the effects it had on different cultures throughout history. I found this class to be insightful and I gained a lot of knowledge about the early technology’s and the impacts we can still see today.</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">PHI 105 Contemporary Moral Problems</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lecture dove into questions surrounding morality.&nbsp; In this class we would often discuss what morality is and how it influences the decisions people make in their everyday lives.&nbsp; We would often read texts by ancient and well-known philosophers and try and relate their theories to things we have seen today. We questioned theories and tested them out in certain scenarios.&nbsp; It was a class that helped me to be critical of what I read and to also think critically about the situations in my own life.</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">PSY 331 Social Psychology </span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lecture elaborated on the human mind when in social situations.&nbsp; Some topics covered in this class included self-esteem, relationships, attachment, conflict resolution, and identity. This class was useful in gaining more knowledge about myself and how I interact and create relationships with others. This class has made me more mindful of my thoughts, motives, relationships, and social interactions I have with others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">Connection between PHI 105 and PSY 331</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two classes I believe have a meaningful connection are PHI 105 Contemporary Moral Problems and PSY 331 Social Psychology. Both classes have touched on the topic of the self.&nbsp; Social Psychology focused more on connections and relationships with others and Contemporary Moral Problems focused on the self and how one deals with situations. One of the most important things that both classes have touched upon is the idea of how people understand themselves. In PHI 105 there was the topic of understanding your own morality and being able to identify with things you agree or disagree with.&nbsp; In PSY 331 there was the topic of the self where we discussed self-esteem and self-identification. This idea of self-identification connects with the idea of morality because it is a part of what makes us who we are. Morality is a big part of how we view ourselves and the world. This understanding of Morality plays a role in the kind of person we see ourselves as. Both classes also focus on how society shapes us.&nbsp; PHI 105 highlighted how society shapes our morality and how we view the world around us. PSY 331 highlighted how society shapes our perspective on situations which is very similar to morality. Overall both these classes were reflective and helped me to be more aware how I view myself and society and why I view myself and society that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">Connection to Global Pathway Topic </span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The class that connects strongly to both the Global Pathway topic and my future career is PHI 105 Contemporary Moral Problems.&nbsp; Within this class we analyzed and viewed morality through the lens of society and culture.&nbsp; We discussed how morality is different depending on what kind of culture and society you are in.&nbsp; This concept is important to understand when involved in a media that can be used as a representation of culture and society.&nbsp; The concept of morality is something that is incorporated in many video games and is what immerses the player.&nbsp; In order to accurately represent a culture or society that may be different than my own, I must be able to understand it and the morality within the culture.&nbsp; Misunderstanding how a culture views issues such as the death penalty, lying, marriage, and many others, can cause a drastic misrepresentation which is an issue that many different media have. I want to be able to properly respect cultures and represent them through video games.&nbsp; The things I have learned in this class have stuck with me and will be the reason I will be able to accurately represent different cultures within my career. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: x-small;">An excerpt from a paper I wrote for PHI 105</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: x-small;"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">I have included an excerpt from a paper I wrote because in this paper I discuss the different moralities based on the perspective of the culture.&nbsp; I talk about how one cannot compare the morality of two cultures because it will always come from the perspective of their own culture.&nbsp; I also talk about how morality differs in these different cultures. In the future, when I create video games, I will always need to be mindful with how I create situations and portray morality.&nbsp; I will need to understand the morality of different cultures in order to be able to represent them accurately.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Thematic Pathway: Media, Innovation and Entrepreneurship</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">The topic of my Thematic Pathway is Media, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&nbsp; This topic is all about the development and impact of media.&nbsp; Many classes within this topic analyze media and provide a space to innovate and create things using multiple different media. This topic also highlights the history of innovation and its contribution to society today. The classes that I have taken to complete my Thematic Pathway requirement are COM 240 Survey of Mass Communication, DMS 259 Introduction to Media Analysis, and DMS 448 Games, Gender and Culture.</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">COM 240 Survey of Mass Communication </span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lecture focused on the history of mass communication and its contributions to present day society.&nbsp; Within the class we were expected to analyze different forms of mass communication and compare them to each other. </span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">DMS 259 Introduction to Media Analysis</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seminar focused on the history and development of media and its effects on modern culture. Media we discussed in that class included photography, film, recorded sound, print, television, video, and new media. We look at these different media through the political, social, and economic lens. We evaluated the impact that media has on society today. </span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">DMS 448 Games, Gender and Culture</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This seminar focused on the representation of gender and culture within video games. Within the class we looked at different video games and analyzed how they portray such topics as gender, race, and culture. We were expected to be critical of these games and also be mindful of the messages that are being portrayed to the players.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">Connection between COM 240 and DMS 259</span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both COM 240 Survey of Mass Communication and DMS 259 Introduction to Media Analysis focus on the effects of media and communication in society today.&nbsp; The forms of new media have created ways in which mass communication is at its all time high.&nbsp; Both classes analyze how new media has affected communication and changed it.&nbsp; Now it is much faster and more convenient to communicate with others.&nbsp; Anyone anywhere could broadcast themselves to a large audience of people at any time.&nbsp; This has changed society drastically; it has made communication time shorter and has made people demand information faster.&nbsp; Both classes highlight the positive and negative effects of new media. A positive effect being that the world is more connected than ever before. A negative being that there is more of an opportunity for people to spread negativity and hate to larger amounts of people because they are anonymous and have the means to do so.&nbsp; Both classes have given me the tools to be critical of media and to be more mindful of its effects on society.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">Connection to Thematic Pathway topic </span></strong></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DMS 448 Games, Gender and Culture is a class that really connects to the Thematic Pathway topic of Media, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.&nbsp; This class also strongly connects to my academic major and the career that I strive for.&nbsp; Video games are a growing media that is innovative within itself. It calls for developers to produce and create new, fun, and meaningful experiences for its players. This class provided me with the knowledge and tools to criticize this growing media, as well as create it. This class is a Digital Media Studies class which is my major.&nbsp; The media that was studied in this class is games and its effects and representation on gender and culture.&nbsp; In the future I want to help create video games and I feel that before someone can create something, they must understand it. This class gave me a great foundation for being more mindful about the decisions that go into creating a game and how those decisions represent people and culture. Everything I have learned in this class will stay with me and help me become a better innovator, analyzer, and developer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"> <img src="/images/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-25%20at%2012.52.37%20PM.png" width="536" height="516" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;"></span></p> 
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: x-small;">Screenshot from Blog Post</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;font-size: small;color: rgb(0,0,0);"></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">This blog post is a representation of the analytical skills I have gained within this course. In the blog post I discuss my personal experience with the lack of female representation and the inaccurate representation of females within video games.&nbsp; I then was able to connect my experience with the readings we were given in class. I was able to analyze the specific media of video games and its effects on players like myself.&nbsp; I was also able to broaden the scope and view the effects this representation, within video games, can have on society.&nbsp; This is an example of the understanding I have gained and the kind of work I will be doing throughout my career as a game developer.&nbsp; The impact games can have and the message they can send throughout society is something I will always keep in mind when creating my own games in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
