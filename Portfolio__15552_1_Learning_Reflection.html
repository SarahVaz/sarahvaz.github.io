 <h3 class="section-title">Transition to DMS Major</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;During my freshman and sophomore years at UB, I was majoring in Computer Science.&nbsp; My motivation was always to find my way into the gaming industry.&nbsp; However, I realized that the programming aspect was not&nbsp;my passion.&nbsp; While I was majoring in Computer Science, I was taking DMS classes as electives.&nbsp; In these classes I would often analyze different media and their impact on society.&nbsp; Within these classes we were given that chance to look other media like video games and how they have impacted and represented different aspects of society.&nbsp; To my surprise I enjoyed looking at video games in an analytical light and understanding that, just like other media, they have an impact on society. This led to my decision to change my major and focus on the design and analytical aspects of video games.</span></p>

 <h3 class="section-title">Growth during DMS 448</h3>
 <div class="vtbegenerated"> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have taken DMS 448 Games, Gender and Culture during my senior year. This class is a representation of how much I have learned and how much I have grown as a future game developer.&nbsp; </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The beginning of the semester we often discussed and focused on how specific video games have represented gender and culture.&nbsp; We would have to write weekly blog posts on the topics that were discussed in the assigned readings and in class.&nbsp; I have written a few blog posts that focus on the representation of women in specific games and I have discussed the message it sends to the player and the overall impact it could have on society.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(136,136,136);font-size: x-small;">Screenshot of Blog Post</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within this blog post I discussed the stereotypes and misrepresentation of women within the video game <i>Dead Island</i>.&nbsp; I was able to point out how women are represented and how race is also represented.&nbsp; I talk about the game mechanics that are most commonly associated with women and what that says about the gender roles.&nbsp; Toward the end I reflected on the gradual change in the representation of women in video games and how important it is.&nbsp; This example shows my ability to analyze and think critically of this media and its impact. </span></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;color: rgb(0,0,0);font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;"> </span></span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This ability to analyze media was a skill I already had before going into this class.&nbsp; That skill evolved into my ability to analyze video games and how its mechanics, narrative, and design all speak to many different social issues even without the players being aware. When I would play video games, I would just mindlessly go through them and believe that they served no further purpose than for people to just enjoy them and have fun.&nbsp; This class allowed me to look deeper and connect the games I have played to their impact and representation of society.&nbsp; My analytical skills evolved and became more specific to my career, but it doesn't stop there.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;font-size: 13.0px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the semester we were expected to work on a project.&nbsp; This project was to create a playable game that speaks on an issue of either gender, race, sexuality, society, or culture in general.&nbsp; We were expected to take what we have learned and apply it to our own game.&nbsp; For this project I decided to create a narrative “choose your own adventure” game.&nbsp; The topics that I focused on in my game were stereotypes about women.&nbsp; I created a dystopian society in which you play as a young girl and these stereotypes are front and center.&nbsp; The player is given chooses in the game which change how the game plays out. These choices revolve around whether the player plays into these stereotypes or goes against them.&nbsp; The message of my game is to highlight the ridiculous nature of these stereotypes and to show the emotional harm that it does to women.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;font-size: small;color: rgb(0,0,0);"> </span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These screenshots from my game show how I have exaggerated gender roles and stereotypes in order to highlight how ridiculous they are.&nbsp; Throughout this class I have grown and evolved to the point where I can do more than just analyze other games, I can create them.&nbsp; More specifically, instead of just looking at how other games represent gender I am now able to create my own game that speaks on this issue of misrepresentation.&nbsp;</span></p> 
 <p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot; , serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This evolution and growth are something I am extremely proud of.&nbsp; I have gone from analyzing the effects of media on society, to specifically looking at video games as an impactful media, to ultimately being a creator of meaningful and representational games that speak on the faults of society.&nbsp; This growth is something that will continue as I start my career in game development.&nbsp; It is an aspect of my career that is extremely important, and I am so proud and happy to have gained the skills I have throughout my years here at UB.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
